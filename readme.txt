== Frequently Asked Questions ==


**How many keywords can I add?**

You can add as many keywords you like. However, if you need to track more than a thousand keywords, you will need to contact our support in order to unlock our abuse safety limit.

**How many domains can I add?**

The plugin will only track keywords for the site you installed the plugin on. You can however install the plugin on all your Wordpress sites and connect it to the same Wincher account, but this is only possible to our PRO users. Users with multiple domains will probably have a better experience checking their rankings at Wincher.com.

**What search engines does Wincher support?**

At the moment we support 68 different Google search engines all around the world. We continuously update the list and we will soon also add Bing to the list.

**My Google result does not match Wincher’s result. What is wrong?**

A couple of things can cause this difference. The most common reason is that Wincher collects ranking in incognito mode. This means that the particular search engine is not trying to give you a better result deepening on your location or previous search queries. Another common reason is that Wincher collects ranking only once a day for each keyword and that rankings can change during the day.
